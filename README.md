# slacktail.py

Slacktail is a simple Python script that tails a Slack channel and prints new messages to the console.

It is inspired by https://github.com/DannyBen/slacktail, but is written in Python and uses the Slack API directly.
I wanted to be able to support `xoxc` tokens (tokens used by the Slack Web app), but my Ruby-foo is not strong enough to be able to add that feature to the original slacktail.

## Installation

`pip install slacktail`
